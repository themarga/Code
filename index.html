        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
         Technology is becoming an indispensable part of the modern age, encouraging progress, creativity and connectivity. However, this rapid development and endless search. niver 1. fo for the latest gadgets has led to the emergence of an important but sometimes overlooked ition' sp problem: electronic waste or e-waste. The pro b This disposal of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones and other electronics, is becoming a major global problem with far-reaching effects on the

environment and society. At Lovely Professional University (LPU), we value environmental protection. and sustainability, and part of this commitment is the responsible handling e-waste LPU's large campus, which of e values innovation and cutting-edge technology, is not exempt from the problems caused by e-waste
The university, with its expanding student body, faculty and staff, is uniquely positioned to lead by example in addressing this pressing issue

The 21st century has witnessed an unequaled proliferation of technology, making electronic bias an necessary part of our divinal lives. While these inventions have revolutionized. how we work, communicate, and learn they've also steered in a daunting challenge electronic waste or e-waste. This design is an disquistion of LPU's commitment to addressing this challenge and fostering a culture of sustainable waste operation.

With the nonstop emergence of slice-edge widgets and the ever-syncopating lifetime of electronic products, e-waste has come a global environmental concern. a.

LPU, a dynamic and forward-allowing educational institution, recognizes the need to take visionary way to manage - waste responsibly

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Electronic waste contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. When improperly
            disposed of in landfills, these toxins can leach into the soil and water, contaminating ecosystems and
            posing health risks to humans and wildlife.

            <strong> CONCLUSION
                It is concluded that e-waste is a relatively new segment in the global removal. It is also the lowest growing segment 2PU in discarded way problem in the LPU is largely ignored and misunderstood so the query. needs to be addressed before any solutions can be effective E-waste improper disposal of i any number of electronic devices.
                These devices include computer equipment cell phones, or most other, televisions, consumers in developed nations are.These devices include computer equipment cell phones, or most other, televisions, consumers in developed nations  are quick o replace their devices because. technological advances. of continuous
                Electronic and electrical equipments. be avoided in today's world. So also is the cannot case of waste electronic and electrical equipments Adoption of environmentally sound technologies for recycling and reuse of e-waste along with EPR and ROHS offers workable solutions for environmentally sound management of e-waste.
